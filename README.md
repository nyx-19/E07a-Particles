# E07a-Particles
in my main1, I made rain. I did this by chosing to use the muzzle asset and flip the velocity to a negative number so it would fall instead of rise. I also gave it some x velocity so it looks like it's a windy storm! Finally, I cut back on the number of colors I used just because I felt there were too many and I prefered it to be a bit smaller.



p.s. PSSST, I made a second file that is exactly the same as my main1, but I really just wanted to make a purple rain joke!
